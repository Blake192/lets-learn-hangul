    description: `
This letter makes a sound like
**g** or **k** in English.

Korean doesn’t make a distinction between
**g** and **k** sounds, so you may see this letter written
either way in English. Usually people pick **g** at the
start of a syllable and **k** at the end.

Sometimes the bottom part will curve inwards to make it a little more visually balanced, like so:

<img src="/images/examples/g-versions.png" width="111" height="33" />

This letter sounds like **ch** in English.

Depending on the font, sometimes the little stroke
on the top will be vertical. And sometimes the “legs” at
the bottom attach in the middle instead of on the right.

Here’s a few examples of ㅊ:
<img src="/images/examples/ch-versions.png" width="250" height="40" />

We don’t have this sound in English, but it’s somewhere
between **r** and **l**—probably closer to **l**. It’s usually
written as **r** at the beginning of words, and **l** at the end.

In a lot of cursive fonts, it looks kind of like a 3 with a tail.
And sometimes people are lazy and just right it kind of like a z.
