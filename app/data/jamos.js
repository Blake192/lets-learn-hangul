    description: `
This letter makes a sound like
**g** or **k** in English.

Korean doesn’t make a distinction between
**g** and **k** sounds, so you may see this letter written
either way in English. Usually people pick **g** at the
start of a syllable and **k** at the end.

Sometimes the bottom part will curve inwards to make it a little more visually balanced, like so:

Depending on the font, sometimes the little stroke
on the top will be vertical. And sometimes the “legs” at
the bottom attach in the middle instead of on the right.
